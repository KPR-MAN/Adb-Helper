## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

**Essential for Both:**

    *   Download from the official [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools).
    *   **‚ÄºÔ∏è CRITICAL:** Add the `platform-tools` directory containing `adb.exe` (Windows) or `adb` (Linux/macOS) to your system's **`PATH`** environment variable.
    *   Verify by opening a *new* terminal/cmd and typing `adb version`. It should output the version number.

**Tool Specific:**

*   **For `Adb Helper (GUI)` üé®üêç:**
    *   **Python 3.x:** Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). (Tkinter is usually included; install `python3-tk` on some Linux distros if needed).
*   **For `Adb Helper (Script)` ‚å®Ô∏è:**
    *   **PowerShell:** Included in modern Windows. Install [PowerShell Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) for Linux/macOS.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

### Using the GUI üé®

1.  Go to the `Adb-Helper` folder.
2.  Run the Python script:
    *   **Windows:** Double-click `Adb Helper (GUI).py` or run `python "Adb Helper (GUI).py"` in CMD/PowerShell.
    *   **Linux/macOS:** Run `python3 "Adb Helper (GUI).py"` in the terminal.
3.  Use the buttons and input fields. Output appears in the bottom text area.

### Using the Script ‚å®Ô∏è

1.  Go to the `Adb-Helper` folder.
2.  Open PowerShell in that directory (e.g., `Shift + Right-click` -> "Open PowerShell window here" on Windows).
3.  Execute the script:
    ```powershell
    .\Adb Helper (Script).ps1
    ```
    *(**Note:** You might need to adjust PowerShell's execution policy. Try `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process` for the current session if you get an error. Be mindful of security implications.)*

## üìå Troubleshooting & Notes

*   **"ADB Not Found" Error:** This is common! **RE-CHECK** that the `platform-tools` folder is correctly added to your system `PATH`. **Restart** terminals or the GUI after updating the `PATH`. Test with `adb version` in a *new* terminal.
*   **PowerShell Script Execution Policy:** If the `.ps1` script won't run on Windows, see the note in the [How to Use](#user-content-using-the-script-%EF%B8%8F) section about `Set-ExecutionPolicy`. *(Self-correction: Need to update this link too)*
*   **GUI "Start Shell":** Tries to open `adb shell` in a new, separate terminal window. Behavior might vary by OS.
*   **Stopping `logcat`:** Use the "Stop Logcat" button (GUI) or press `Ctrl+C` (Script).
*   If the Gui can't open or crashes: Make sure the icon.png are in the assets folder.
