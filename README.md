## Requirements 📋

- **Windows Operating System** 💻
- **PowerShell** (for the script version) ⚙️
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH. The script will attempt to locate ADB in the following locations:
  1. ADB in your system's PATH 🔍
  2. Default Android SDK location (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\platform-tools`) 📂
  3. A fallback location (`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools`) ⚠️

If ADB is not found, the script will notify you to install it or update the fallback path.

## Usage 🚀

### Script Version 📝

1. **Download the Script**:  
   Clone or download the repository.

2. **Run the Script**:  
   Open PowerShell and run the script.

3. **Execute Commands**:  
   Once the script is running, you can input commands interactively. Type `help` to see available commands.

4. **Exit**:  
   Type `exit` to stop the script.

## Configuration ⚙️

The script attempts to detect the path to `adb.exe` automatically. If ADB is not in the system's PATH, it will try the default SDK location and a fallback directory. If ADB is still not found, the script will display an error message and prompt you to exit.

### Customizing ADB Path 🛠️

If needed, you can manually specify the path to `adb.exe` by updating the fallback path in the script:
```powershell
$fallbackPath = "C:\Path\To\Your\SDK\platform-tools"
```
